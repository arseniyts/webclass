<p>
<i>Arcanum</i> begins with a <a target = "blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_scene">cut scene</a> of the <i>IFS Zephyr</i>, a luxury <a target = "blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeppelin">zeppelin</a>, on her <a target = "blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_voyage">maiden voyage</a> from Caladon to Tarant. Two monoplanes, piloted by Half-<a target = "blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogre">Ogre</a> bandits, close in on the craft and commence attack runs, succeeding in shooting it down. An old gnome who is a passenger aboard the <i>Zephyr</i> is now in his death throes under charred <a target = "blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debris">debris</a> and tells the player to bring a silver <a target = "blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(finger)">ring</a> to "the boy," and promptly dies. Being the only survivor of the crash, the main character is proclaimed as "The Living One," a holy reincarnate, by the only witness to the crash, Virgil. The story follows the player's path as he searches for the origin of the ring. Over the course of the game, the player uncovers more about the history of the continent, the motivation of the assassins who are trying to kill him, and the identity of the one threatening to end all life in the land.<sup><a id = "note 18" href = "#note 18">[18]</a></sup>

<i>Arcanum</i> is an example of a <a target = "blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-ended_(gameplay)">non-linear</a> role-playing game. At various points throughout the game, players may take the story in different directions, sometimes permanently removing different paths of action. The game's central <a target = "blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest">quest</a> ultimately develops according to how players navigate its <a target = "blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy">dichotomies</a>, the most apparent being that of <a target = "blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(gaming)">magic</a> and <a target = "blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology">technology</a>. Many of the game's side <a target = "blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_gaming)">quests</a> allow for more than one solution depending on the player character's specializations and certain portions of the main quest can be solved more easily through dialogue than through combat. The game's magic/technology and good/evil alignments also influence what followers a character can attract throughout the game or how other <a target = "blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character">NPCs</a> will react to the player.<sup><a id = "note 19" href = "#note 19">[19]</a></sup>
